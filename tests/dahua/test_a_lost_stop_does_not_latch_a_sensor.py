"""A Stop that arrives while the event stream is down must not be lost for good.

A latching event's sensor is on for exactly as long as its timestamp is
non-zero, and **only** a Stop zeroes it. So when the stream drops between a
Start and its Stop, the Stop is never seen and the sensor stays on until a
later complete pair or a restart of Home Assistant. `diagnostics.py` has
reported the symptom for a while without anything acting on it: an event age of
21600 seconds is a binary sensor that has been on for six hours.

The fix asks the device, on reconnect, which events it still considers active,
and closes the ones it does not. That is better than clearing everything, which
is what Home Assistant's own ONVIF integration does on a lost subscription
(`async_mark_events_stale`), because asking is evidence and assuming is not.

**The thing that nearly made this unsafe**, measured on a DHI-NVR5464-16P-EI:

    code=VideoMotion          200  channels[0]=14
    code=CrossLineDetection   200  Error: No Events
    code=NotARealCodeAtAll    200  Error: No Events

A real code with nothing active and a code the endpoint knows nothing about
return the **same thing**. So an empty answer is not evidence an event ended,
and clearing on it would switch off a live sensor for any code the event stream
reports and this endpoint does not. That is the opposite of the bug and worse:
a security sensor reading clear while something is happening.

So the codes this endpoint can be trusted about are learned from the device, the
same way `event_is_momentary` learns what a Pulse is. The tests below are mostly
about that, because it is the part that can do harm.
